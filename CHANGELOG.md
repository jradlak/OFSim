0.27.5 - CHANGELOG.md added. Minor files in folder structure refactor. Code formatter added as a submodule project (clang-format, google-style)

0.27.4 - Improvents in the Camera behaviour in the Trajecotry Prediction Mode, enabling physics in trajectory prediction

0.27.3 - Enable/disable autorotation switch (new element in GUI)

0.27.2 - Loading screen.

0.27.1 - Fix in displaing operation manual.

0.27.0 - Savig source code files in File Save Dialog.

0.26.3 - Filesystem navigation in the File Dialog.

0.26.2 - Corrections of the initial camera position in the trajectory prediction mode.

0.26.1 - In manual control mode, displaying velocity and thrust vector indicators.

0.26.0 - Manual control mode. It is now possible to manually control the rocket using user's computer keyboard.

0.25.1 - Rocket's initial orientation fixes. Now the rockt is fully perpendicular to the planet's surface at point (0, y, 0). The appropriate rotation of the planet ensures the correct geographical coordinates.

0.25.0 - Diagnostics mode.

0.24.1 - Fully working VM integration.

0.24.0 - Restore a previously removed virtual machine.

0.23.2 - Serious code reactorings: remove quaternions, and simplification of the inital rocket orientation code.

0.23.1 - Fixes in the planet texturying. Change size of the planet. Point (0, 0, 0) is now in the center of the planet and the origin of the simulation.

0.23.0 - Python integration. Remove Virtual Machine.

0.22.2 - Fixes simulation resetting process. Now full reset is possible when simulation is stopped.

0.22.1 - Code editor line numbers.
