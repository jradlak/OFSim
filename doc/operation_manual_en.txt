The program has three basic modes:

    1. Manual control of the flight
    2. Automatic control
    3. Flight trajectory prediction

Additionally, there is a third diagnostic mode that is not directly accessible to the user.
The trajectory prediction mode can be accessed at any time from the first two modes once the simulation has started.
During the rocket flight, it is not possible to switch between modes 1 and 2.

Manual Flight Control Mode:

In this mode, the rocket flight is controlled using the keyboard.

Available keys:

    1. r - activate manual control mode / return to automatic control mode.
    2. z - increase engine thrust
    3. x - decrease engine thrust
    4. c - positive rotation of the thrust vector direction on the x-axis
    5. v - negative rotation of the thrust vector direction on the x-axis
    6. b - positive rotation of the thrust vector direction on the y-axis
    7. n - negative rotation of the thrust vector direction on the y-axis
    8. , - positive rotation of the thrust vector direction on the z-axis
    9. space - negative rotation of the thrust vector direction on the z-axis

Automatic Flight Control Mode:

This is the default mode of the simulator.
In this mode, the rocket flight is controlled by executing pre-recorded flight instructions (flight program).
This effectively allows for the programming of the rocket flight in a chosen programming language. Two languages are available: low-level assembler and Python.
Descriptions of the assembler and the PYTHON language API are included in separate documents.

To start the simulation in this mode, you must first load the flight control program from the disk or write it from scratch in the embedded editor within the simulator.
